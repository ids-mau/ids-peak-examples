# C# Examples – IDS peak Generic SDK

This directory contains C# examples demonstrating how to use the IDS
peak Generic SDK via its **.NET** Bindings.

The examples require at least:
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1** (classic)
- **.NET 6** (modern)

## Requirements

- An [IDS peak Setup](https://en.ids-imaging.com/download-peak.html) (Runtime Setup which provides the GenTL is enough)
- .NET SDK / Visual Studio for building and running examples

> Note: The C# bindings include the necessary runtime DLLs to run the
> examples.
Installing the IDS peak Runtime Setup is still required to provide the necessary GenTL for device access.

## Build Instructions

The IDS peak SDK relies on **native (unmanaged) DLLs** that are
distributed inside the referenced NuGet packages.

Because native binaries are involved, you **must specify the target
architecture via `-p:Platform=<arch>`** when building. This ensures that
your application is built for an architecture that can correctly load
the required native libraries.

If **no `RuntimeIdentifier` (`-r`) is specified**, all available native
runtimes from the packages will be copied to your build output.
This would normally maximize compatibility but increase the application size.
However, when the Platform parameter is specified, other architectures
are not supported (except for x86 on x64).

You may **optionally specify `-r <rid>`** to reduce the size of the build
output by including only the native libraries for a single runtime.

### .NET (modern, SDK-style)

**Required (correct architecture selection):**

```bash
dotnet build -p:Platform=x64 exampleProject.csproj
dotnet run  -p:Platform=x64 --project exampleProject.csproj
```

**Optional (smaller output):**

```bash
dotnet build -r win-x64 -p:Platform=x64 exampleProject.csproj
dotnet run  -r win-x64 -p:Platform=x64 --project exampleProject.csproj
```

You can substitute another architecture/runtime pair if needed, e.g.:

* `-p:Platform=x86` (optionally with `-r win-x86`)
* `-p:Platform=x64` with `-r linux-x64`

### .NET Framework (classic)

Use Visual Studio **or** build from the command line:

```bash
# Restore packages first
msbuild exampleProjectFramework.csproj /t:Restore

# Build for a specific platform (required for native DLLs)
msbuild exampleProjectFramework.csproj /p:Platform=x64
```

## NuGet

IDS peak .NET packages are available on NuGet and can be added with:
```bash
dotnet add package IDSImaging.Peak.<PackageName>
```
