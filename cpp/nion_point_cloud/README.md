# Depth Map Acquisition and Point Cloud Generation Example

Demonstrates how to acquire multipart image data from an **IDS Nion** camera and convert it into a metric 3D point cloud
with per-point intensity information (XYZI).

This example shows how to open and configure an IDS Nion camera, acquire multipart image buffers containing a depth map
and an intensity image, and process this data into usable 3D information. It illustrates how to convert raw depth values
into floating-point metric coordinates, filter invalid or out-of-range depth measurements, and apply factory calibration
data to undistort both depth and intensity images.

In addition, the example demonstrates how to generate a point cloud from the processed depth data, associate each 3D
point with an intensity value, and write the resulting depth maps, intensity images, and point cloud data to disk for
further processing or visualization.

## Example workflow

The example performs the following steps:

* Opens the first connected IDS Nion camera
* Configures camera parameters such as exposure time and confidence threshold
* Acquires multipart image data (depth map and intensity image)
* Converts the raw depth map into metric floating-point coordinates
* Filters invalid and out-of-range depth values
* Undistorts depth and intensity images using factory calibration data
* Generates a 3D point cloud with per-point intensity values (XYZI)
* Writes depth maps, intensity images, and point cloud files to disk

## Requirements

This example depends on the following components:

- An **IDS Nion** camera
- [IDS peak standard Setup](https://en.ids-imaging.com/download-peak.html) version 2.19 or later
- **CMake** version 3.10 or later
- A supported C++ compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
